We subtract 2 for the network and broadcast addresses, leaving 254 usable host addresses.\n2. **Determine the subnet mask**: To divide the network into 6 equal subnets, we'll need to create a new subnet mask that allows each subnet to support at least 25 usable hosts. Since 25 = 1/10 of 254, we can use a /27 (256-25=231) or more precise /28 (256-30=226) subnet mask for this task.\n3. **Calculate the size of each subnet**: With a /28 subnet mask, there will be 2^7 = 128 possible host addresses per subnet (after subtracting network and broadcast). This is more than sufficient to support our minimum requirement.\n4. **Subnetting process**:\n\t* Take the original network address 192.168.50.0/24 and split it into 6 equal parts using the /28 subnet mask.\n\t* The first subnet will be 192.168.50.0/28, with host addresses from 2 to 127 (inclusive).\n\t* Continue this process for a total of 6 subnets, each with host addresses ranging from 1 to 126 in each subsequent subnet.\n5. **Verify the result**: Confirm that each subnet has at least 25 usable host addresses.\n\nAnswer: The network is successfully divided into 6 /28 subnets, supporting at least 25 usable host addresses per subnet.", "final_answer": "Answer: The network is successfully divided into 6 /28 subnets, supporting at least 25 usable host addresses per subnet.", "elapsed_ms": 26711, "domain": null, "valid": null, "validation": null}
