> [!Abstract]
> Cisco IOS commands follow strict syntax and offer built-in help tools for learning and troubleshooting.

## Key Ideas
- Every command has **keywords** and **arguments**.  
- Syntax rules define the required format.  
- Context-sensitive help (`?`) guides usage.  
- Hot keys and shortcuts speed navigation.

## Definitions
- **Keyword:** Predefined command word.  
- **Argument:** User-defined value.  
- **Context-Sensitive Help:** Shows available options.  
- **Command Syntax Check:** Verifies valid input.  
- **Hot Key:** Key combo that controls CLI behavior.

## Explanation
IOS syntax uses clear notation:  
- **Boldface** = literal commands.  
- *Italics* = user values.  
- [ ] = optional items, { } = required choices.  

Built-in help (`?`) lists commands, arguments, and corrects errors.  
Common shortcuts:  
`Tab` → autocompletion, `Ctrl + C/Z` → exit, `Up/Down` → history.  

## Common Mistakes
- Misplacing spaces in commands.  
- Ignoring case sensitivity or syntax errors.  
- Forgetting to use `?` for help.  

## Quick Checks
- What does the `?` command do?  
- How do you abort a ping test?
