> [!Abstract]
> This hub connects every topic in Module 2, covering the fundamentals of Cisco IOS operation, navigation, configuration, and device connectivity.

## Topics
- [[Cisco IOS Access]]
- [[IOS Navigation]]
- [[The Command Structure]]
- [[Basic Device Configuration]]
- [[Save Configurations]]
- [[Ports and Addresses]]
- [[Configure IP Addressing]]
- [[Verify Connectivity]]

## How It’s Tested
- Identify command-line modes and prompts.
- Apply initial switch configuration and password protection.
- Configure IP addressing for hosts and switches.
- Verify end-to-end network connectivity with `ping`.

## Study Path
