> [!Abstract]
> Protocol suites and open standards form the backbone of interoperability — allowing devices from any vendor to communicate globally.

## Key Ideas
- **Protocol Suite:** Group of protocols that work together (e.g., TCP/IP).  
- **TCP/IP:** Open standard suite maintained by IETF; foundation of the internet.  
- **Open Standards:** Ensure cross-vendor interoperability and innovation.  

## Definitions
- **IETF:** Internet Engineering Task Force — maintains internet protocols.  
- **IEEE:** Develops Ethernet and wireless standards (802.3, 802.11).  
- **ICANN:** Manages global domain names and IP addresses.  
- **ITU-T:** Defines telecom and broadband standards.  
- **EIA/TIA:** Define wiring and connector standards.  

## Explanation
TCP/IP suite layers:
- **Application Layer:** HTTP, DNS, SMTP  
- **Transport Layer:** TCP, UDP  
- **Internet Layer:** IP, ICMP, ARP  
- **Network Access Layer:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi  

Standards organizations define how these protocols interoperate, ensuring consistency across hardware and software.

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing proprietary protocols (e.g., AppleTalk) with open standards.  
- Thinking TCP/IP replaces OSI—it models it.  

## Quick Checks
- Why are open standards important?  
- What are the four layers of the TCP/IP model?
