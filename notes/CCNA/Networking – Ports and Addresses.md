> [!Abstract]
> Introduces how devices communicate using IP addresses and network interfaces.

## Key Ideas
- Every device needs a unique IP address.  
- IPv4 uses 32 bits ( dotted decimal ), IPv6 uses 128 bits (hex).  
- Subnet masks identify network vs host parts.  
- Default gateway routes to other networks.  
- Media types affect speed and distance.  

## Definitions
- **IPv4:** 32-bit addressing scheme.  
- **IPv6:** 128-bit hexadecimal addressing.  
- **Default Gateway:** Router interface for external traffic.  
- **Interface:** Hardware connection point.  

## Explanation
IP addresses enable end-to-end communication.  
Media can be copper, fiber, coax, or wireless, each with different bandwidth and cost.  
IPv6 is replacing IPv4 to support global growth.  

## Common Mistakes
- Misconfiguring subnet masks.  
- Forgetting to set default gateway.  
- Mixing IPv4 and IPv6 incorrectly.  

## Quick Checks
- What is the purpose of a default gateway?  
- How many bits does an IPv6 address use?
