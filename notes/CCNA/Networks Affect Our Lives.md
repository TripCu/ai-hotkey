## Key Ideas
- Communication is vital to modern society.
- Networks connect people, organizations, and devices.
- The internet removes boundaries and builds global communities.

## Definitions
- **Network:** A system of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources.
- **Global Community:** The worldwide interconnection of users via the internet.

## Explanation
Modern life relies on networked connections—email, video, banking, healthcare, education, and entertainment all function across global data infrastructures.  
The “human network” describes how people collaborate using digital tools, bridging distance and culture.

### Diagram Description
A typical diagram shows multiple users connected to cloud infrastructure, symbolizing the global scope of interconnectivity.

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming networking is limited to computers only—phones, IoT devices, and vehicles are also networked.
- Forgetting that networks enable not just data transfer but real-time human collaboration.

### Quick Checks
- How does networking affect daily communication?
- What is meant by the term “human network”?
