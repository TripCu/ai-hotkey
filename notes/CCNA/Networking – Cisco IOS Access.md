> [!Abstract]
> Introduces the Cisco IOS environment and how technicians connect to networking devices using CLI or GUI interfaces.

## Key Ideas
- Devices run an **Operating System (OS)** that controls hardware and software interaction.  
- **CLI** is preferred for network configuration due to reliability and control.  
- **Access methods:** Console (local), SSH (secure remote), Telnet (insecure remote).  
- **Terminal emulation programs** like PuTTY or Tera Term provide CLI access.

## Definitions
- **Shell:** Interface between user and OS.  
- **Kernel:** Core of OS managing hardware resources.  
- **Console:** Physical management port for local access.  
- **SSH:** Secure encrypted remote session.  
- **Telnet:** Unsecured remote session.  

## Explanation
Every Cisco device runs **IOS – Internetwork Operating System**.  
Users can interact with IOS through:  
- **GUI tools** (simple, visual, but prone to failure), or  
- **CLI commands** (precise and used for automation).  

Access is possible through:
1. **Console port** – first-time setup and recovery.  
2. **SSH** – secure remote management (recommended).  
3. **Telnet** – legacy, insecure.  

## Common Mistakes
- Using Telnet in production networks.  
- Forgetting to secure console or VTY lines.  
- Confusing GUI with CLI access requirements.  

## Quick Checks
- Why is SSH preferred over Telnet?  
- What are the three main IOS access methods?
