> [!Abstract]
> Wireless media enable connectivity without cables by transmitting electromagnetic signals through the air, providing mobility at the cost of reliability.

## Key Ideas
- Transmits data using **radio or microwave frequencies**.  
- Provides mobility and flexibility.  
- Susceptible to interference, limited range, and security issues.  
- Standards defined by **IEEE 802.11**, **802.15**, **802.16**, and **802.15.4**.  

## Definitions
- **Wi-Fi (802.11):** Wireless LANs for local access.  
- **Bluetooth (802.15):** Short-range PANs for peripherals.  
- **WiMAX (802.16):** Broadband wireless, long-range.  
- **Zigbee (802.15.4):** Low-power IoT communication.  
- **AP (Access Point):** Connects wireless clients to wired LAN.  
- **Wireless NIC:** Enables device radio communication.  

## Explanation
Wireless signals carry binary data via modulation of electromagnetic waves.  
Each standard differs in speed, range, and purpose:
- **Wi-Fi:** High bandwidth, medium range (indoors).  
- **Bluetooth:** Low power, short range (10 m).  
- **WiMAX:** Citywide broadband coverage.  
- **Zigbee:** Sensor networks and IoT.  

Wireless LANs operate in **half-duplex**, meaning one device transmits at a time.  
Signal quality is affected by **interference**, **distance**, and **obstructions**.  
Security measures (WPA2/WPA3, SSID management) are essential to protect data.

## Common Mistakes
- Assuming wireless is as reliable as wired.  
- Overlooking signal overlap or channel interference.  
- Using default SSIDs and passwords.  

## Quick Checks
- What are the limitations of wireless media?  
- Which IEEE standards define Wi-Fi and Bluetooth?
