> [!Abstract]
> Fiber-optic technology uses light signals for ultra-high bandwidth and long-distance data transmission with immunity to interference.

## Key Ideas
- Fiber carries **light pulses** instead of electricity.  
- **Single-mode (SMF)** for long distance, **Multimode (MMF)** for short.  
- Immune to EMI/RFI and electrical hazards.  
- High cost and specialized installation skills.  

## Definitions
- **Core:** Glass center transmitting light.  
- **Cladding:** Reflective layer keeping light inside.  
- **SMF:** Narrow core; laser-driven; long distance (up to 100 km).  
- **MMF:** Wider core; LED-driven; short distance (up to 550 m).  
- **Connectors:** ST, SC, LC, Duplex LC.  

## Explanation
Fiber sends digital data via modulated light pulses through the glass core.  
The light source — LED or laser — determines range and bandwidth.  
**Dispersion** (signal spreading) limits distance; SMF minimizes it.  

Applications:
- **Enterprise backbones:** building-to-building.  
- **FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home):** broadband delivery.  
- **Long-haul and submarine networks:** intercontinental data links.  

Patch cords (e.g., SC-SC, LC-LC) identify mode by jacket color:  
- **Yellow:** SMF  
- **Orange/Aqua:** MMF  

## Common Mistakes
- Bending fiber beyond radius, causing loss.  
- Mixing MMF and SMF components.  
- Using wrong connector or wavelength.  

## Quick Checks
- What are the advantages of fiber over copper?  
- Why does dispersion affect performance?
