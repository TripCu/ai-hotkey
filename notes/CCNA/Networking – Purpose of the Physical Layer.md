> [!Abstract]
> The Physical Layer converts digital data into signals for transmission across physical media, providing the foundation for all communication.

## Key Ideas
- The **Physical Layer** (Layer 1 of the OSI model) defines the mechanical, electrical, and signaling standards for data transmission.  
- It is responsible for **bit transmission**, not data interpretation.  
- A **Network Interface Card (NIC)** connects a device to the network through physical or wireless means.  
- Without this layer, higher-layer protocols like Ethernet or IP cannot function.  

## Definitions
- **NIC (Network Interface Card):** Hardware that connects a device to a network.  
- **Encoding:** Conversion of data bits into a physical signal pattern.  
- **Signaling:** The process of representing 1s and 0s through electrical, light, or radio signals.  
- **Physical Media:** The pathway (cable or air) that carries signals between devices.  

## Explanation
The Physical Layer is the final stage of data encapsulation.  
It accepts frames from the Data Link Layer and converts them into signals appropriate for the medium — electrical pulses (copper), light waves (fiber), or radio waves (wireless).  
Each signal encodes digital bits, allowing the next device to interpret and reassemble the frame.  

**Example:**  
When sending a ping, Layer 2 frames are encoded as voltage transitions across copper wires, which are then decoded at the receiving device.

This layer is **fundamental**, but **not intelligent** — it doesn’t interpret meaning; it just moves bits.

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing the physical layer’s job (signal transmission) with the data link layer (frame delivery).  
- Ignoring the importance of correct cabling and connector types.  

## Quick Checks
- What type of data does the physical layer handle?  
- How does the physical layer differ from the data link layer?
