> [!Abstract]
> Topology diagrams visualize how devices connect physically and logically within a network.

## Key Ideas
- Topologies describe structure and data flow.
- Physical topology shows physical layout.
- Logical topology shows addressing and communication paths.

## Definitions
- **Network Interface Card (NIC):** Hardware enabling device connectivity.
- **Port:** Physical connection point.
- **Interface:** Logical or physical pathway for communication.

## Explanation
Topology diagrams help administrators understand connectivity.  
Physical diagrams show placement and cable routes; logical diagrams highlight addressing schemes and flow of data.  
They are essential for troubleshooting and documenting networks.

### Configuration Example
```plaintext
Switch# show cdp neighbors
Router# show ip interface brief
