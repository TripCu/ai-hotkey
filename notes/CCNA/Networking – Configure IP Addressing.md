## Key Ideas
- End devices need an IP address to communicate.  
- Addresses can be set **manually** or via **DHCP**.  
- Switches use **Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs)** for remote management.  

## Definitions
- **DHCP:** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for auto IP assignment.  
- **SVI:** Virtual interface for switch management.  

## Explanation
Manual setup: enter IP, subnet, and gateway in network settings.  
Automatic setup: select “Obtain IP address automatically.”  
On Cisco switch:
