> [!Abstract]
> Standards ensure that all network devices can communicate effectively by defining how data is represented, encoded, and transmitted physically.

## Key Ideas
- Physical layer standards govern **components**, **encoding**, and **signaling**.  
- Standards are defined by organizations like **IEEE**, **EIA/TIA**, and **ITU-T**.  
- Signal representation differs by media: electrical (copper), optical (fiber), or radio (wireless).  

## Definitions
- **Physical Components:** The tangible hardware—cables, connectors, NICs.  
- **Encoding:** Converts digital data into recognizable transmission patterns.  
- **Signaling:** Defines how bits are represented on the medium (voltage, light pulse, etc.).  
- **Bandwidth:** Maximum capacity of a medium to transmit data (bps).  
- **Latency:** Delay between transmission and reception.  
- **Throughput:** Actual data transfer rate.  
- **Goodput:** Useful data transfer rate (Throughput – Overhead).  

## Explanation
Standards make cross-vendor communication possible.  
For example:
- **IEEE 802.3** defines Ethernet over copper/fiber.  
- **IEEE 802.11** defines wireless transmissions.  

Encoding schemes like **Manchester**, **4B/5B**, or **8B/10B** ensure that signals remain recognizable and synchronized across devices.  
**Signaling** depends on the medium:
- Copper uses electrical pulses.
- Fiber uses light modulation.
- Wireless uses radio frequency waves.

Bandwidth measures potential speed, but **throughput** is usually lower due to overhead and collisions.

## Common Mistakes
- Believing bandwidth alone defines performance.  
- Forgetting that encoding is essential for synchronization.  
- Mixing up throughput and goodput.  

## Quick Checks
- What are the three functional areas defined by physical layer standards?  
- How does encoding improve communication reliability?
